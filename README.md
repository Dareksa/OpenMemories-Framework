# OpenMemories: Framework #
Build Android apps for your favorite Sony camera.

## How to use ##
1. Add this repository to your dependencies
2. Build your app (see [PMCADemo](https://github.com/ma1co/PMCADemo) for an example)
3. Test it in the emulator
4. Install it on your camera using [PMCA-RE](https://github.com/ma1co/Sony-PMCA-RE)

## Features ##
This is a wrapper framework around Sony specific classes. For every Sony feature, an additional dummy implementation is provided. This allows you to test your app on any Android device / emulator.

This framework is still under development. Most wrappers aren't available yet.
